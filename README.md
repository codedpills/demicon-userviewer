# Demicon Random Users Viewer

You can see preview of the app [https://demicon-userviewer.vercel.app/](here) 

## How to run the app

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn install`

Installs all the dependencies needed for the app to run. You must already have Node and Yarn installed
on your computer.
### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

## Checklist of things that can be done / improved with more time
- Due to time constraints, I could not populate the user details page. However, the page is accessible with description
 of one way I would approach it.
- Add some unit / integration tests for the search and users list
- Improve error handling
- Improve styling, of course :)
- Could still improve code quality, I think
